"""
By default, custom classes are not iterable. We canâ€™t just go around plugging our custom classes into for loops and expecting any results! This presents a problem if the class we are working with needs the ability to iterate.

To fully implement the iterator protocol, and be able to iterate over a custom class, we must define the __iter__() and __next__() methods. In most cases the two methods can do the following:

-+ The __iter__() method can include some class member initializing, but must always return the iterator object itself. Typically, this is accomplished by returning self.
-+ The __next__() method can include any number of operations but must either return the next value available or raise the StopIteration exception.
